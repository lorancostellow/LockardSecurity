#Lockard-Home-Automation

CIT 3rd year project:

Despite an improving economy, securing oneâ€™s home from thieves is still a major problem. Furthermore, 

public awareness of the IOT has created a demand for IOT type applications.  

A small home security firm views this as an opportunity to dramatically change and expand their business.

The security firm has approached your team looking for a bespoke hardware/software solution. In the 

past, this firm concentrated on simply installing house alarm systems without telephone notification or 

any home management features. The now want to move up the value chain and offer a high tech 

monitoring solution.

 

You are tasked with the development of a Home Management System (HMS) for this firm.

The following features could be included in the system:

- House alarm 

- Monitoring and recording of activity within home

- Lighting control 

- Heating and Immersion control

- Fire alarm and carbon monoxide monitoring

- Social media interface

- Custom designed feature unique to each group (each group implements a unique feature not 

already outlined in this spec).

It is anticipated there will be 2 main applications: 

1) Self-Monitoring: 

Customers who will monitor their own homes. 

2) Full Monitoring: 

Customers who want minimum hassle and want the security firm to perform the house 

monitoring and house management 

The first application will involve the development of an android app to interface with the Pi based 

hardware of the HMS. 

The second application will involve developing a web site which will act as a control centre for the 

thousands of customers who choose the Full Monitoring service.  This will be a PHP website most likely 

developed in a WAMP environment. To accelerate the development process, Wordpress may be used as the CMS.
